## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
avg_flip_length <-mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

The “penguins” dataset describes the characteristics of 344 sampled
penguins from 3 different species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) and
several islands. There are 344 rows (each representing a penguin) and 8
columns. Several of the important variables are penguin species, which
island they were found on, body mass (grams), and sex. The mean flipper
length is 200.9152mm.

``` r
flipper_bill_scatter <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)

ggsave("flipper_bill_scatter.pdf", plot = flipper_bill_scatter)
```

## Problem 2

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_norm_samp = rnorm(n = 10), 
  vec_positive = vec_norm_samp > 0,
  vec_chars = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", 
                        "small", "medium", "large", 
                        "small", "medium", "large", 
                        "small"))
)

p2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    vec_norm_samp vec_positive vec_chars vec_factor
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>        <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1        -0.829 FALSE        a         small     
    ##  2         0.264 TRUE         b         medium    
    ##  3        -0.284 FALSE        c         large     
    ##  4        -1.15  FALSE        d         small     
    ##  5         1.68  TRUE         e         medium    
    ##  6         2.34  TRUE         f         large     
    ##  7         0.756 TRUE         g         small     
    ##  8        -0.277 FALSE        h         medium    
    ##  9         1.57  TRUE         i         large     
    ## 10        -0.172 FALSE        j         small

``` r
avg_vec_norm_samp <- mean(pull(p2_df, vec_norm_samp))
avg_vec_positive <- mean(pull(p2_df, vec_positive))
avg_vec_chars <- mean(pull(p2_df, vec_chars))
avg_vec_factor <- mean(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

I am able to take the mean of “vec_norm_samp” and “vec_positive”, but
not my character or factor vectors.

``` r
num_vec_positive <- as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_positive))
num_vec_chars <- as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_chars))
num_vec_factor <- as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

When applying as.numeric() to vec_positive, it converts the values from
TRUE/FALSE to ones and zeroes. This is because R can treat “TRUE” as 1
and “FALSE” as 0. When applying as.numeric() to vec_chars, it shows a
warning message. When applying as.numeric() to vec_factor, it replaces
the levels with their respective level rank.

This does somewhat explain what happens when you try to take the mean of
these variables, as it must convert the values in vec_positive to 0/1
before averaging the column. We are unable to convert the character
vector to a numeric and take the mean. Even though we can convert the
factor vector to a numeric vector, we cannot directly calculate the mean
of the factor vector.
