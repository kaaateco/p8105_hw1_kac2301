## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
avg_flip_length <-mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The “penguins” dataset describes the characteristics of 344 sampled
penguins from 3 different species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap) and
several islands. There are 344 rows (each representing a penguin) and 8
columns. Several of the important variables are penguin species, which
island they were found on, body mass (grams), and sex. The mean flipper
length is 200.9152mm.

``` r
flipper_bill_scatter <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) + 
  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)

ggsave("flipper_bill_scatter.pdf", plot = flipper_bill_scatter)
```
